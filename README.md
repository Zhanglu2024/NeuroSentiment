# CSAN-DCAS: Enhancing Social Media Sentiment Analysis with EEG and AI


## Project Overview

Harnessing social media data has become pivotal for real-time sentiment analysis and public health monitoring. Traditional methods rely on textual or image-based sentiment extraction, often failing to capture the neurophysiological dimensions critical for understanding emotional states and decision-making processes.

This study introduces an innovative framework integrating **EEG (electroencephalogram) signals** and artificial intelligence to improve sentiment analysis precision and adaptability across cultural contexts. The proposed framework includes:

- **Cultural Semantic Alignment Network (CSAN):** Enables robust cross-contextual sentiment decoding.
- **Dynamic Cultural Adaptation Strategy (DCAS):** Dynamically adapts and refines features iteratively to address contextual disparities.

### Key Contributions:
- Combines EEG signals with AI for nuanced sentiment feature encoding.
- Bridges cultural and contextual gaps in sentiment analysis.
- Demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy and adaptability over conventional techniques.
